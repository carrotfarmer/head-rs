I Love Angular.js - Ben Awad & Nick White

Angular.js is
Kind of an empress
And it's not just the dress
It's the way she can impress

Turning legacy systems into vintage tech
Earning my respect
And altering the life of every dev
(Bro, what are you talking about man?)

[Verse 1: Ben Awad]
Google supposed to be top-tier
Angular.js devs are the only ones with tears
Call me a staff-engineer
Because I'm going to need a spear
To steer through this code

Already on another version
Angular.js ain't no virgin
No other framework be this thicc
Millions of bytes shе's a brick

Extra side of boilerplate
Java bе jealous at this rate
Got my data two-way binded
No React.js, she got me blinded
More dependency injection
Giving classes a good connection
Completely misunderstood
Folder structure straight out of the hood

I've never felt so safe
TypeScript prevents the chafe
HTML templates are the best
Just need to get that off my chest

[Verse 2: Nick White]
They call me
The Angular killa'
I keep my JS vanilla
October of 2010 you were released
Since then there hasn't been peace

Made by Google, you are bitch made
They are so dumb, they rejected me
FAANG till' you die, or deprecate
But they can't protect your resume

The worst framework that was ever made
And that's now your only skill?
But what projects even use that still?
I don't know any
I think Angular.js was a bomb
Facebook had it right with the Virtual DOM
And now it's hard for you to get a job
When you are not up-to-date
Because you made a mistake

[Verse 3: Ben Awad]
I used to be FAANGsexual
Now I'm not even flexible
Please don't show me Leetcode
I don't want to reverse a node

Angular.js got me down
So much legacy code
I feel like I'm about to drown

I can't help but be depressed
I don't want to leave tech
But it's for the best

Carrots give me armor
Now I'm a farmer
Plowing fields for fun
Angular.js was like staring into the sun

Laying down seeds with a promise
Spring awaits a little son named Thomas
Life goes by so fast
Boilerplate is a thing of the past
I'm at the peak of my career
No more fear
Just satisfaction
Angular.js didn't even give me a fraction
